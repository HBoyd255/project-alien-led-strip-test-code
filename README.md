# Project A.L.I.E.N. WS2812B Test Code

<!-- Harry Boyd - 13/08/2024 - github.com/hboyd255 -->

This repository contains code that allows me to test the WS2812B LED strip used
on the Project A.L.I.E.N. robot.

The datasheet for the WS2812B LEDs can be found
[here](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/WS2812B.pdf).
